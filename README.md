# Scala Downloader #

A simple file downloader (like wget) written in Scala. 

I'm building this project only for learning purposes :flushed:

## Next steps
+ Tests
+ Resume downloads
+ Download rate limit [not sure yet]
+ Akka actors for multiple file downloads

## Build & run ##

```
sbt "~ run http://file.url"
```
